    <h1>Hello, English 388</h1>
    <p>I'm a Senior at UW studying English, although the sad truth is that I couldn't tell you the last time I read a book that wasn't assigned to me. 
      I am originally from Spokane, but my family moved to the Seattle area a couple years ago. My hobbies include buying nerdy stuff on ebay and hanging
      out with my girlfriend, Maile, who I am getting an apartment with next year in Capital Hill or possibly Wallingford. As for other notable plans,
      we want to get a few pet rats, too. Right now I'm stuck on Ogilvy and Ernstine as potential names. </p>
