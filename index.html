    <h1>Hello, English 388</h1>
    <p>I'm a Senior at UW studying English, although I couldn't tell you the last time I read a book that wasn't assigned to me. 
      I am originally from Spokane, but my family moved to the Seattle area a couple years ago. I have a girlfriend, Maile, who I am
      getting an apartment with next year in Capital Hill or possibly Wallingford. As for other notable future plans, we want to get
      a few pet rats. Right now I like Ogilvy and Ernstine as possible rat names. </p>
