    <h1>My Favorite Foods</h1>
    <p>My favorite meal has to be pho. <strong>Nothing beats that broth.</strong> I am partial to Thai and Greek food, as well,
        and I love a good burger. Recently my favorite place to get a burger has been Shake Shack. My favorite meal that
        my mom makes is red curry with chicken, which I have had a lot but never seem to grow tired of. My favorite dessert
        is probably ice cream cake or pie of any variety.</p>

    <h1>My Favorite Bands</h1>
    <p>To give you a straight answer on my favorite band of all time is difficult, but for the last two years my top
        artist has been Radiohead by a landslide, which I think accurately captures my frequent obsession with their music.
        This last year I gave their album <em>Kid A</em> another chance after not liking it the first time, but I am so
        glad that I did because it quickly became one of my favorite albums of all time. If I had to name other bands that have been crucial
        to my psychological development, I would be remiss to not mention Pink Floyd and my bloody valentine, which is spelled without
        capitalization so don't you dare think I spelled it like that by mistake. I would describe the latter's music as a blanket
        that covers you completely in sweet, sweet sound. Lately, the bands that I have been listening to the most are The Smiths, Muse, and
        The Velvet Underground. I just recently discovered Muse, which is crazy to me because their music fits perfectly within
        my taste. I like their most popular album, <em>Black Holes and Revelations</em>, but an earlier album from 2001 called
        <em>Origin of Symmetry</em> is also really good.</p>
